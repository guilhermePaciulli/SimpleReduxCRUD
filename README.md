# SimpleReduxCRUD

<h3>Project proposal</h3>
<p>The goal for this project is to create a simple CRUD application with Redux Architecture (Using 
<a href = "https://github.com/ReSwift/ReSwift">ReSwift</a>) running on Swift 3.0 code and CoreData database.</p>

<p>I have tried to isolate each component at it`s max to create a good decoupling between each component of the project. For
example functions related to database (create, read, update and delete). I also have tried keeping the view as distant as I
could from the project's logic.</p>
<h3>Project idea</h3>
<p>The idea is pretty simple, the user inserts a beer on a table view, by clicking in it it show's the beer like in an 
inspector, there you can edit the beer's attribute. By clicking edit on the table view the user can delete a beer. </p>
